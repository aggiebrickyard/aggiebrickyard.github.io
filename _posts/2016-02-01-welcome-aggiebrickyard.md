This website was built using the **[Voyager](http://redvi.github.io/voyager)** [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme, and provides a home for The Aggie Brickyard. This publication is entirely grad student inspired and maintained, with the help and input from an amazing group of graduate students, staff, and faculty in the [Graduate Group in Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/).
