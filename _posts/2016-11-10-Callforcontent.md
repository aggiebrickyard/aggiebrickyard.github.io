### Assembling the Blocks of Ecology

The aGGiE Brickyard provides an opportunity to connect with other students and faculty as well as alumni, donors, and future employers. To that end, please see the attached call for content. All submissions must be received by **November 14th at 5pm**.

Please send all submissions to the Aggie Brickyard Editors at **_brickyardeditors @ gmail.com_**. In addition to the content that we’re calling for below, feel free to submit anything that you think is worth reading.

The Fall 2016 issue will focus on Gender and Diversity in the GGE. We already have a few articles on this topic lined up, but we would love to receive any additional submissions y’all may have on that topic (as well as any on any topic).

#### Research Spotlight

This section will highlight the breadth of research activities and intellectual accomplishments in the GGE. Here’s what we’re looking for:

**Current Science (1000 word limit)**

 > Do you have some exciting new findings for us to feature? Please send us an article on your current research, written in a scientific journalism style. Feel free to refurbish existing press releases. Include photos!

**Stories from the Field (500 word limit)**

 > Share the joys and tribulations of your fieldwork experiences! We’re looking for anecdotes that showcase the diversity of our research systems and methods, demonstrate ingenuity, provide levity, caution, or advice, or are just plain cool. Photos, please!

**Student Perspectives (500 word limit)**

 > This is a space for students to share thoughts about their research and graduate school experience. Send us your favorite recent blog post, or write something new for The Brickyard!

**Student Publications (Citation only)**

 - Please send us any citations for first-author publications from the past 6 months!
 - Conference and Award Corner (One line per conference or award)
 - Please let us know what conferences you’ve attended in the past 6 months, and any awards or special recognition you received. We'd also love to include group photos of GGE members at the conference (wearing posters as capes is not required, but obviously encouraged).

#### Community

This section is a space for discussion about GGE life, original satirical articles on ecology, GGE artwork, and other engaging submissions intended to build our community.

**Light-Hearted Articles (500 word limit)**

 > Submit original articles on life in Davis, the GGE, satirical science, politics, or whatever you feel. This is a chance to have a discussion with our community.

**Natural History (250 word limit)**

 > Information pertaining to the timing, location and strategies of natural phenomena. Things like migrations, breeding or bugling, wildflower shows, meteor showers, etc.

**Student Group Highlights**

 > Are you part of a student group on campus? Any updates on the current quarter? Please send us your info. Photos encouraged.

#### Fun and Visual

This section is for content to make people smile. Or contemplate the meaning of life...

**Photos/Artwork**

 > Please send us your photography and artwork. These can be landscapes, people, places, etc. Anything that represents your research or ecology life. Feel free to make your photo submissions interactive. Readers can guess the person/place/object: any photos of ecology celebs, places, or things.

**Poetry**

 > Submit your ecology or natural history poetry! Please keep it brief.

**Funny stuff**

 > Are you funny? Prove it. Send us your best ecology or science-related jokes. Jokes not your thing? We take comics. If it’s good, we’ll make you a regular.

**Potpourri**

 > Short stories, IM sports photos, costume photos, etc!
