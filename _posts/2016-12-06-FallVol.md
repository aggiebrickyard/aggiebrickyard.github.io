**NOW AVAILABLE:** Fall Issue of The Aggie Brickyard â€“ Gender and Diversity in Ecology

We are pleased to announce that the Fall 2016 issue of The Aggie Brickyard is available on our website in high and low resolution. This issue is largely themed around Gender and Diversity in Ecology and has several engaging submissions. We hope it generates thoughtful conversation and gives folks a taste of the many perspectives on these issues.

Additionally, thanks to support from Ted and the GGE, we will have printed copies available shortly (before the holidays!) and will send out a quick announcement on when and where you can pick those up.

Please keep an eye out for the call for content for the Winter issue of The Brickyard. And as always, your feedback and submission ideas are always welcome.

Happy Holidays!
