**NOW AVAILABLE:** Winter Quarter Issue of The Aggie Brickyard â€“ Advocacy and Research in Ecology

We are pleased to announce that the (slightly delayed) Winter Quarter 2017 issue of The Aggie Brickyard is available on our website in high and low resolution. This issue is largely themed around Advocacy and Research in Ecology and has several engaging submissions. We hope it generates thoughtful conversation and gives folks a taste of the many perspectives on these issues.

Additionally, thanks to support from Ted and the GGE, we will have printed copies available shortly and will send out a quick announcement on when and where you might be able to find one.

Please keep an eye out for the call for content for the Spring issue of The Brickyard. And as always, your feedback and submission ideas are always welcome.

Happy Spring!
