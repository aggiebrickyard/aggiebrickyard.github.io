**NOW AVAILABLE:** Summer Issue of The Aggie Brickyard â€“ Teaching

We are pleased to announce that the Summer 2017 issue (Spring somehow escaped us) The Aggie Brickyard is available on our website in high and low resolution. This issue is largely themed around **Teaching** and has many thoughtful and potentially helpful articles. We hope you find it interesting and worth a read.

Additionally, thanks to support from Ted and the GGE, we will have printed copies available shortly and will send out a quick announcement on when and where you might be able to find one.

Please keep an eye out for the call for content for the Fall issue of The Aggie Brickyard. And as always, your feedback and submission ideas are always welcome.

Happy Spring!
