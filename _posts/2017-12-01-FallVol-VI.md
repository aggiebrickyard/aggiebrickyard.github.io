**NOW AVAILABLE:** Fall Issue of The Aggie Brickyard â€“ Rejection

We are pleased to announce that the Fall 2017 issue (is it 2018 now?!) The Aggie Brickyard is available on our website in high and low resolution. This issue is largely themed around **Rejection** and has a few thoughtful and potentially helpful articles. We hope you find it interesting and worth a read.

Additionally, thanks to support from Ted and the GGE, we will have printed copies available shortly and will send out a quick announcement on when and where you might be able to find one.

As always, your feedback and submission ideas are always welcome.

Enjoy your Winter Quarter!
