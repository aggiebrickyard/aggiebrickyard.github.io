**NOW AVAILABLE:** Fall 2019 Issue of The Aggie Brickyard â€“ Debate

We are pleased to announce the Fall 2019 issue of The Aggie Brickyard! With an eye to current events, not to mention the academic discourse we all swim in, this issue is themed around **Debate**.

A digital version of the issue is available online. Plus, thanks to support from Truman and the GGE, we have distributed physical copies around commonly-frequented GGE spots on campus (...happy hunting! Or contact us to request your own copy.).

As always, your feedback and submission ideas are welcome.
