**NOW AVAILABLE:** Spring Issue of The Aggie Brickyard â€“ Community

We are pleased to announce the Spring 2020 issue of The Aggie Brickyard, themed for the *Community* that marks this graduate group.

A digital version of the issue is available online. Plus, for the first time ever, we have offered home delivery of print editions to GGE community members around Davis. This was made possible with the support of the Ecology Graduate Student Association. 

For many of us, this spring has been a time warp. The days spent sheltering at home inch by, while world events seem to constantly accelerate. The pieces here were crafted in April and May, and already we live in a different world. Bear in mind the temporal dissonance as you read, and please feel free to reach out to us with any questions, comments, or concerns.

As always, your feedback and submission ideas are welcome.

*Your Brickyard Editors*

Please feel free to [download the PDF]({{ site.url }}/assets/brickyardpdfs/TAB_SQ2020_Compressed.pdf), however keep in mind it is ~10 MB in size.
