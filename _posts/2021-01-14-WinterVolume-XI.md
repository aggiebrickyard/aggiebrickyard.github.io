**NOW AVAILABLE:** Winter Issue of The Aggie Brickyard – Mileposts

We are pleased to announce the Winter 2021 issue of The Aggie Brickyard, **Mileposts**.

What's a milepost? We picture the small and unprepossessing stakes arrayed along a highway to remind you that you’re moving forward in an otherwise featureless landscape. Toward something, away from something else. Somehow, members of the GGE have managed to take steps forward through the (sometimes literal) haze that characterized the past nine months of pandemic, protest, and fire.   

A digital version of the issue is available online. And once again, we are offering to-your-door delivery of the issue. Big thanks to the GGE for funding this endeavor!

As always, we welcome your feedback and submission ideas.
