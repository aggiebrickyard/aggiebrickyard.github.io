**NOW AVAILABLE** Summer Issue of The Aggie Brickyard - Keystone

We are happy to bring you the Summer 2023 issue of The Aggie Brickyard, **Keystone**.
Keystone is meant to provide the GGE with a space to reflect joyfully, critically, and creatively on the people, places, institutions and ideas that support us and the role that we ourselves play in supporting our community.

A digital version of the issue is available online, with print copies available upon request. Thank you to the GGE and EGSA for funding this endeavour and everyone who generously contributed their talents, ideas, and reflections to this publication.

As always, we welcome your feedback and submission ideas.
