**NOW AVAILABLE** Spring Issue of The Aggie Brickyard - Carpe Davis

Happy April Fool's- this is not a joke! We are happy to bring you our 15th issue, the Spring 2025 edition of The Aggie Brickyard, **Carpe Davis**.
In these challenging times our goal for this issue was to encourage you to embrace what remains bright and search for silver linings. We found them in the humor, shared musings, and creativity of our beloved GGE community.
We hope you enjoy the lightness and silliness of this issue so that you can continue to seek joy and share it with our community!

A digital version of the issue is available online now. Thank you to everyone who generously contributed their talents, ideas, and reflections to this publication.

As always, we welcome your feedback and submission ideas.
