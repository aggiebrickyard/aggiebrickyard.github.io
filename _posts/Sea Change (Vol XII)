**NOW AVAILABLE:** Winter Issue of The Aggie Brickyard â€“ Sea Change

We are happy to bring you the Winter 2022 issue of The Aggie Brickyard, **Sea Change**.

Why sea change? Maybe it feels like your life is in the midst of a wild transition, or maybe it's the world around you that's changing. Maybe both. In this issue, we recognize the ever-continuing tumult of our times, and the transformations we may never have asked for.

A digital version of the issue is available online. And once again, we are offering to deliver a copy straight to you. Big thanks to the GGE for funding this endeavor!

As always, we welcome your feedback and submission ideas.

*Your Brickyard Editors*
